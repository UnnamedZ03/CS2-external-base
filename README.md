# CS2-external-base
## A simple CS2 base made by me. Pay attention to the reasoning and not to the way I draw, nor to the messy structure of the code.
### UC link : [HERE](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counter-strike-2-a/599932-cs2-external-base-source-code.html#post3847411)
#### Features :

- [x] Team Check
- [x] ESP box
- [x] ESP Health
- [x] ESP Distance
- [x] ESP Text Health

(The memory and driver parts have been removed because I don't want to publicize my writing and reading methods. Consequently, you'll have to implement your own. NVIDIA Overlay is required)
